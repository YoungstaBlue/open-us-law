"""Ingest US state constitutions into the open corpus.

corpus_type='state_constitution', act_id prefix 'SCONST_<ST>_'

Architecture: per-state config object. Each state has a discovery function
that returns (article_id, html_text, url) tuples, then a single uniform
parser splits articles into sections.

Most states are scraped from their own official .gov publisher. A small
number fall back to an open mirror where no reproducible official source
exists; those are listed in `_WS_INLINE_STATES` with the reason inline.

Run:
    OUT_DIR=./data python scripts/constitutions/ingest_state_constitutions.py --states ca
    OUT_DIR=./data python scripts/constitutions/ingest_state_constitutions.py --states ca,tx,ny --workers 8
    OUT_DIR=./data python scripts/constitutions/ingest_state_constitutions.py --all

Writes newline-delimited JSON chunk records to
$OUT_DIR/state_constitutions_chunks.jsonl.

# Amendment/ratification years -- data already sitting in raw_text, unparsed

# Every Wikisource-sourced state (scrape_wikisource_inline, 37 states) has its
# own official amendment-history annotation transcribed inline: it sits in its
# own paragraph right after the affected section's substantive text and
# before the NEXT "Section N." marker (verified 2026-08-05 against live
# rendered HTML for VA: the note is a <small> tag positioned exactly there),
# so the existing article/section split in scrape_wikisource_inline already
# attributes it to the correct section's raw_text -- it is just never parsed
# out into amendments_count/amendment_years/last_amended_year.
#
# The format is NOT uniform across states. Sampled 37 of 37 Wikisource states
# live 2026-08-05 across three passes (see docs/us-corpus/CORPUS_RICHNESS_TODO.md
# item 1.9 for the full survey): VA ("The amendment ratified November 5, 1996
# and effective January 1, 1997-...") and MD ("(added by Chapter 422, Acts of
# 2006, ratified Nov. 7, 2006; amended by ..., ratified Nov. 2, 2010; ...)")
# both use the literal word "ratified" immediately before each date, verified
# consistent enough to share one pattern. WI ("[As amended Nov. 1982 and
# April 1986]"), AK ("[Amended 1972]"), and MN ("[Amended, November 8,
# 1988]") are each their own bracketed date format. TN ("[As amended: Adopted
# in Convention ..., Approved at general election ..., Proclaimed by
# Governor, ....]", sometimes chaining several such events with "; As
# Amended:") is its own longer bracket format. NC ("(2013-300, s. 1.)")
# embeds the year directly in a trailing session-law citation. CT ("(Sec. 8
# amended in 1982. See Art. XVII of Amendments to the Constitution ...)")
# points to a separate amendments article rather than revising the text in
# place, but the "amended in YEAR" phrase itself is clean and consistent. WY
# ("This section was amended by a resolution adopted by the 1980
# legislature, ratified by a vote of the people at the general election held
# on November 4, 1980, and proclaimed in effect on November 14, 1980.") is
# its own prose sentence, distinct from VA/MD's shorter "ratified DATE"
# phrase. LA ("Amended by Acts 1989, No. 840, S1, approved Oct. 7, 1989, eff.
# Nov. 7, 1989; Acts 2003, No. 1295, ...") chains session-law citations like
# NC/MD. NH ("<dd>Amended 1974 adding sentence to prohibit
# discrimination.</dd>", one `<dd>` per amendment event, several can stack
# under one section) is its own short-form annotation. Two of the five
# bespoke (non-Wikisource) scrapers were sampled too, since they already have
# a working scraper and a real source page: CA ("(Sec. 2 amended June 3,
# 1980, by Prop. 5. Res.Ch. 77, 1978.)", leginfo.legislature.ca.gov) carries
# both the voter-ratification date and the legislature's own resolution
# year. TX ("(Feb. 15, 1876. Amended Nov. 5, 1918.)", tcss.legis.texas.gov)
# prints the ORIGINAL 1876 enactment date bare, with no "added"/"amended"
# keyword, right alongside a real "Amended DATE"/"Added DATE" citation in the
# same parenthetical -- the extractor keys on the keyword specifically so
# 1876 (an enactment date) is excluded, the same way the federal
# Constitution fix excludes 1788 from `amendment_years`.
#
# 26 of the 37 Wikisource states were sampled and found NOT safely extractable, each for a
# specific, checked reason, not left unchecked: KS, DE, HI, IL, MS, NV have
# no per-section annotation of any kind. ID, OH, MT, WA, NM mix several
# notation styles within the same document, most sections undated. AZ, GA,
# SC, WV have only generic prose mentions of "amendment"/"ratified" unrelated
# to tracking any specific section. NJ, OK, NY's apparent hits were Wikisource
# TOC/navigation link text, not real annotations. MO has an "(as amended in
# YEAR, YEAR, ...)" note, but it is a "Source:" line describing the
# PREDECESSOR 1875 constitution's own amendment history before this text was
# carried into the 1945 constitution -- a different fact than "when was the
# CURRENT text last amended," so extracting it under `amendment_years` would
# be reporting the wrong document's history under the right document's
# label; not attempted. OR's actual article text lives on separate per-article
# Wikisource subpages (`Oregon_Constitution/Article_N`), not the main page
# `scrape_wikisource_inline` fetches, so no per-section format could be
# sampled at all from the page this ingester actually scrapes -- flagged
# separately as a possible scraper-coverage gap, not an amendment-format
# question. VT only has a whole-DOCUMENT currency line ("AS ESTABLISHED JULY
# 9, 1793, AND AMENDED THROUGH NOVEMBER 5, 2002"), not per-section dates.
#
# A state absent from _AMENDMENT_YEAR_EXTRACTORS below is left at
# amendments_count=0 deliberately, not attempted -- guessing at a format
# never actually verified would risk reporting confidently wrong amendment
# history, which this corpus's own convention (see the federal Constitution
# fix, item 1.5/1.9) treats as worse than an honest gap. All 37 Wikisource
# states have now been checked at least once, and 2 of the 5 bespoke-scraper
# states (CA/TX) besides. The remaining 3 bespoke states (PA, KY, MI) and the
# 8 states with no registered scraper at all in this file (AL/AR/IA/IN/ME/ND/
# RI/UT -- confirmed against STATE_SCRAPERS below, not assumed from the
# `_WS_INLINE_STATES` comment, which is stale on this point: it still lists
# PA/KY/MI as "missing on Wikisource... TODO" even though all three already
# have their own working bespoke scraper further down this file) are
# genuinely unsampled for this. PA's source is geo-fenced and unreachable
# from environments without the scraper-box proxy; KY/MI were not attempted
# this pass. A genuinely new state here needs its own from-scratch source
# investigation, not an extension of any pattern below -- none of the
# bespoke scrapers share Wikisource's transcription conventions, and CA and
# TX did not even share each other's.

# The generic `\n(?:SECTION|Section|Sec\.)\s+(\d+...)` split only matches a
# section header that literally starts a line with one of those three words.
# Several states use a different convention entirely, so the regex never
# matches and the whole article silently falls back to one section_number="0"
# blob. Same shared-function-plus-override-dict shape as
# `_AMENDMENT_YEAR_EXTRACTORS` above: the generic path is untouched for every
# state not listed here.

    `Section` inline, so the min-length filter, R2 mirror key convention, and
    default title format can never drift between states.

    `r2_pdf_url` (new): pass this instead of `r2_html_url` for PDF-sourced
    states (NM/WA and most of the Tier-2/PDF-format states in C07) -- exactly
    one of the two should be set, matching whichever `Section.r2_*_url` field
    the source document actually mirrors to.

    `r2_docx_url` (new, CO): same idea for DOCX-sourced states -- mirrors the
    `r2_pdf_url` handling exactly (a whole-document provenance pointer, same
    per-section-repeated-URL precedent already accepted for PDF sources).

    `article_title` (new): pass the article's own name/heading text when the
    source provides one (e.g. "Bill of Rights", "Declaration of Rights") --
    it flows through to the `article_name` payload field in `_build_one`.
    Several already-shipped scrapers (CA/PA/MI/KY) already set this; WV/NV/
    NM/WA currently don't capture it (their ARTICLE_RE regexes don't retain
    the title text in a group) -- worth adding when convenient, not a
    required retrofit. New C07 states should capture it from the start where
    the source's ARTICLE heading includes a name, since it is materially
    richer metadata than a bare roman numeral and costs nothing once the
    regex already has to match past that text anyway.

    per match via `_emit_section`, and falls back to a single whole-article
    Section (section_number="0") when no section markers are found -- same
    behavior that was previously duplicated near-verbatim inside
    scrape_wv/scrape_nv/scrape_nm/scrape_wa (right down to the R2 key
    convention and the "no sections found" fallback), which is exactly the
    kind of copy-pasted boilerplate that let the same "article-split eats its
    own trailing newline" bug get independently rediscovered three times
    (WV, NM, WA) instead of fixed once.

    `fallback_section_res`: tried in order if `section_re` finds nothing in
    an article's body, before giving up to the whole-article fallback (e.g.
    WA's `_COMPACT_ORDINANCE_RE` for its one article with no "SECTION"
    keyword at all).

    `article_titles`: optional {article_id: title} map for states whose
    article-split regex captures a title (see `_emit_section`'s
    `article_title` docstring) -- pass a dict comprehension built alongside
    `art_iter`, not a change to `art_iter`'s own tuple shape.

    A repeated section number within one article (NV: a currently-effective
    and an already-adopted-but-not-yet-effective version printed side by
    side under the same number) gets a "-v2"/"-v3" suffix rather than
    silently overwriting the first -- both are real, separately citable
    text, not a scrape artifact.

    States with genuinely deeper nesting than Article > Section (NJ's
    Article > Subpart > Paragraph, MA's Part > Chapter > Section > Article,
    GA's expected Article > Section > Paragraph) should NOT force their
    shape through this function -- write a custom loop calling
    `_emit_section` directly at the leaf, the same way `_parse_nj`/
    `_parse_ma` already do. This function is for the shape that fits, not a
    dumping ground for every shape with a workaround bolted on.

    than a silent success.

    Internally this escalated to a commercial scraping service on failure.
    That tier is not part of this repo (it needs a paid API key and adds
    nothing reproducible), so the magic-byte check is the whole difference
    from `_fetch_bytes_proxy` here. A soft block therefore surfaces as a
    `_DROPS.fetch_failed` for that state rather than as zero silently
    ingested sections, which is the outcome the check exists for.

    Added for C07 batch 6: `_fetch_bytes_proxy` alone previously counted a
    200 response as success unconditionally, but iga.in.gov (IN) started
    returning its own React app shell (200, `text/html`, ~700 bytes) for
    this exact PDF path partway through this batch's own local testing on
    2026-08-08 -- a soft block that looks nothing like the 403/timeout the
    plain proxy path already handles, so it would otherwise have silently
    ingested zero real content while still reporting success up the call
    chain. The scraping service's residential pool did not clear it either in the same

# "nv" entry), which the page itself flagged as incomplete transcription
# ("This work is incomplete... source document not known") and only ever
# carried the Preamble + Article I (2 live points before this fix).
# leg.state.nv.us/const/nvconst.html is the Nevada Legislature's own official,
# currently-maintained page (carries its own "[Rev. <date>]" revision stamp)
# and has the complete document, all 19 articles including Article XVIII
# (repealed 1992, kept for historical reference). Confirmed live 2026-08-07.
# Needs the US proxy (Cloudflare-blocks unproxied fetches).
#
# Each article opens with a short table-of-contents-style preview (bare
# "N.  Title" lines, tab-aligned with runs of non-breaking spaces) before the
# real numbered sections start; the section-split regex below only matches
# the REAL "Section." / "Sec:" markers (never the bare TOC numbers, which
# carry no keyword), so the whole TOC preview lands in the discarded
# "text before the first match" span for free -- except the TOC block's own
# one-time "Sec." column-header token, which DOES collide with the keyword
# pattern; the negative lookahead for trailing non-breaking-space padding
# excludes that one false match without needing separate TOC-detection code.
#
# A handful of sections legitimately appear TWICE under the same number: NV
# prints both a currently-effective version and an already-adopted-but-not-
# yet-effective future version side by side (e.g. Sec. 7 of Article 6, one
# "[Effective through November 27, 2028...]" and one "[Effective November 28,
# 2028, if... Assembly Joint Resolution No. 8 (2025)...]"). Both are real,
# separately citable text, not a scrape bug -- the second (and any further)
# occurrence of a section number within one article gets a "-vN" suffix
# rather than silently overwriting the first.

# self-executing and has lapsed, so the current official printing simply
# does not carry it as a live article, confirmed live 2026-08-08 via 404s on

# direct fetch from a non-US IP connection-refused). Each page is already
# exactly one article, so there is no article-split step at all -- just a

# confirmed live 2026-08-08 this is NOT a scrape gap: Wikisource's own page
# carries a 15th "TRANSITION SCHEDULE" article with 6 more sections that the
# official ilga.gov site does not publish at all (no con15.htm), because the
# 1970 constitution's transition schedule was self-executing and has already
# been spent -- the same "historical TOC range vs current in-force count"
# class NM's Article XI hit, not missing content).

# Arizona -- replaces the Wikisource source (see _WS_INLINE_STATES' former
# "az" entry). azleg.gov already pre-splits the constitution into one page
# per section (`/const/{article}/{section}.htm`), discovered via the TOC at
# `/constitution/` (which links every article as `constitution?article=N`,
# confirmed live 2026-08-08: articles 1-22, 6.1, 25-30 -- no 23/24, not a
# scrape gap, the TOC itself never lists them) and each article's own index
# page (`constitution?article=N`, which links every section page directly).
# The per-section pages are bare 1990s-era static HTML (`<P>` tags, literal
# `<!Creation Date: ...>` typist comments, no CSS classes), unlike the
# statute scraper's modern divs -- but rather than reconstruct URLs from a
# filename/directory-encoding formula (a real quirk: decimal numbers become
# an underscore in a FILENAME segment but stay a literal dot in a DIRECTORY
# segment), this scraper reads the real target URL directly off each
# article-index page's own links, sidestepping the encoding question
# entirely -- the site already did the encoding, no need to reverse it.
#
# Article 4 (Legislative) is the one article split into "Part 1" (Initiative
# and Referendum) and "Part 2" (the Legislature itself), each with its OWN
# Section 1, Section 2, ... -- confirmed live 2026-08-08 via the article-index
# page's link text ("Part 1 - Section 1" / "Part 2 - Section 1"). Folded into
# article_id as "4.1"/"4.2" (dot convention, matching the site's own existing
# dotted article numbering for 6.1) to keep every (article_id, section_number)
# pair unique; section_title carries the proper "art. 4, pt. N, § M" reading
# for humans, so the fold is purely an internal identifier convenience, not a
# citation-correctness compromise.
#
# Each section page's <title> reliably carries "Article N Section M - " then
# the catchline (verified across both a decades-old typist page and a
# freshly-added 2024 amendment page, the two structurally different formats
# found live), so the catchline is read from there rather than parsed out of
# the malformed inline markup (an unclosed <u>/<font> pair spanning two <P>
# tags in the older pages) -- then the catchline's first occurrence and any
# leading bare "N." / "Section N." label are stripped from the flattened body
# text, which handles both formats without needing to fix the malformed HTML.
#
# No per-section amendment history is published on these pages at all (both
# a decades-old and a freshly-added section were checked live 2026-08-08,
# neither carries one) -- left out of _AMENDMENT_YEAR_EXTRACTORS
# deliberately, not attempted, same convention as the module-level survey
# above for states with no extractable per-section format.

# Maryland -- replaces the Wikisource source (see _WS_INLINE_STATES' former
# "md" entry). mgaleg.maryland.gov serves the constitution through the
# IDENTICAL ASP.NET walk API and page template MD's own statute scraper
# (scrapeMD.py) already uses: `div#StatuteText` at
# `/mgawebsite/Laws/StatuteText?article=<code>&section=<code>` for content,
# and `/api/Laws/GetNext` / `/api/Laws/GetPrevious` (articleCode/sectionCode
# query params, response wrapped in a .NET XML `<string>` envelope) to walk
# the section ring within one article -- scrapeMD.py's own `_list_articles`
# comment already notes the Articles dropdown lists BOTH the statute codes
# ('g*') it scrapes AND the constitution codes ('c0', 'c1', 'c11a', ...) it
# explicitly filters OUT; this scraper is that filtered-out half. Confirmed
# live 2026-08-08: the walk works identically for constitution codes (same
# GetNext/GetPrevious API, same seed "1" reaches every article's first
# section -- simpler than the statute walk's multi-seed table, since
# constitution section codes are plain "1", "2", "3"... not statute-style
# "1-101"). scrapeMD.py uses vaquill_pipeline's fetch_html (statute-scraper
# infra); this module has its own fetch_text/proxy stack, so the walk is
# reimplemented against that instead of importing across the two frameworks.
#
# c0 (Declaration of Rights) has no roman-numeral article number at all --
# its TOC label is bare "Declaration of Rights", and its walked units are
# themselves called "Article N" (not "Section N" nested under a numbered
# Article like every other MD constitution article). Modeled as article_id
# "DR" with the walked code as section_number, and a dedicated citation
# format ("Md. Const., Decl. of Rights art. N") rather than forcing it
# through the generic "art. {article}, § {sec}" template that fits every
# other MD article.
#
# No per-section amendment/ratification history is rendered in
# `div#StatuteText` at all -- checked live 2026-08-08 against several
# heavily-amended sections (Article II § 1 governor's term, Article I § 1
# elections) that the Wikisource transcription DID annotate inline; the
# official site's own page simply doesn't carry it (a different rendering
# choice by the source, not a scrape gap). `_va_md_amendment_years` is
# already registered for "md" from the Wikisource era and stays registered
# (harmless no-op against this source, ready if a future request adds
# amendment metadata from elsewhere), but produces amendments_count=0 across
# the board here, not attempted further.
#
# 303 sections / 351 chunk records, BELOW Wikisource's 557 pts baseline --
# investigated live 2026-08-08 rather than shipped on faith, per the batch
# file's own testing checklist: walked Article III (Legislative) and IV
# (Judiciary) section-by-section and confirmed the GetNext ring correctly
# includes lettered/decimal inserts (35A, 40A-C, 41A through 41-I, 14A/14B,
# 18B, 21A) and correctly skips genuinely-repealed numbers (III's 8, 37,
# 41-42, 47; IV's many gaps) rather than stopping early. All 29 real
# articles are present (confirmed against the Articles dropdown itself,
# which has no "c10" at all -- MD's old Article X was repealed, not a
# discovery gap). The batch file's own research already flagged MD's
# Wikisource baseline as BUG_PRESENT (not CLEAN like MN/AL/IL); a lower,
# verified-complete count from the authoritative walk API is the expected
# outcome of fixing that bug, not a red flag.

# Alabama -- AL has no scraper in this file at all before this (see the
# module-level amendment-years survey's note that AL is one of 8 states with
# no registered scraper, not a Wikisource replacement). Source is the SAME
# `alison.legislature.state.al.us/graphql` endpoint AL's own statute scraper
# (scrapeAL.py) already POSTs named queries to -- reuse the pattern (POST
# through the US proxy is NOT needed here; confirmed live 2026-08-08
# this endpoint answers named GraphQL queries directly even though browser
# introspection is Cloudflare-blocked), not scrapeAL.py's code directly
# (this module has its own fetch stack, no cross-framework import).
#
# `constitutionTitles` returns the SAME flat ROW_SEP/FIELD_SEP
# ("∫"/"†") hierarchy string as the statute scraper's `codeOfAlabamaTitles`,
# but flatter: Article -> Section directly, no Chapter level. Confirmed live
# 2026-08-08: 18 real roman-numeral articles (I-XVIII), 382 sections total,
# matching the batch file's verified count exactly.
#
# CRITICAL scope boundary: the SAME flat list continues past Article XVIII
# straight into a much larger "Local Provisions" branch (132 county/
# municipality Titles, 862 Chapters) that reuses arabic "Article 1",
# "Article 2", ... numbering per county -- confirmed live this is
# immediately adjacent in the row order with no separator. That is not part
# of the state Constitution and must never be pulled in by accident. Since
# `[IVXLC]+` cannot match an arabic digit, the article-header regex already
# excludes local-provisions "Article 1" rows on its own; scanning stops
# outright (not just skips) at the first row that is neither a roman-numeral
# Article header nor a Section row under a currently-open real article, so a
# stray non-Article/non-Section row can never be silently absorbed into the
# preceding real article either.
#
# `constitutionItems(where: { codeId: { in: [...] } })` returns full
# `content` (clean `<p>` HTML) and `history` (an amendment/ratification
# citation, e.g. "(proposed by Act 98-409, ratified January 6, 1999, as
# amendment 622)") batched by codeId -- fetching by codeId directly (already
# known from the hierarchy walk) instead of a second per-displayId lookup,
# since displayId is NOT unique across the Local Provisions branch (many
# counties independently have their own "Section 1"). The `history` format's
# "ratified <date>, <year>" phrase is the IDENTICAL shape the Wikisource-era
# `_va_md_amendment_years` extractor already matches, so it is reused
# directly rather than writing an AL-specific regex.

# Wisconsin -- replaces the Wikisource source (see _WS_INLINE_STATES' former
# "wi" entry). docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/constitution/wi_unannotated serves a
# single PDF for the whole document (NOT the HTML the original batch research
# assumed from a cached preview -- confirmed live 2026-08-08 the URL's own
# Content-Type is application/pdf; docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/constitution/wi
# is real HTML but only a section-link index with no body text, and each
# per-section HTML page, e.g. /document/wisconsinconstitution/I,9m, turned
# out to render a whole PRINT PAGE of the PDF -- several neighboring sections
# at once, not just the one requested -- so the PDF is the cleaner
# single-fetch source). The PDF is a genuine two-column layout; plain
# single-column extraction interleaves lines from both columns and garbles
# the text, so this uses `pdf_to_text(..., columns=2)`.
#
# Even with columns=2, the first ~1-2 pages physically interleave the tail of
# the document's own table of contents (which lists every section under
# every article, left column) with the start of the real body text (right
# column) -- a real per-page 2-column layout artifact, not a bug in the
# extraction. `_wi_strip_toc_noise` removes the resulting bare "N.\nTitle.\n"
# TOC-entry runs (2+ in a row) and the standalone "Section" column-header
# line; what remains is real prose everywhere, so an ARTICLE-header match is
# trusted as a real boundary only when genuine section content (matched by
# `_WI_PDF_SECTION_RE`) starts within a short window after it -- the leftover
# bare "ARTICLE N.\nTITLE\n" headers (with no body immediately following, TOC
# artifacts of the same page-interleaving) are filtered out by that check
# rather than by position/gap heuristics, which proved unreliable against
# this specific two-column pagination. Verified live 2026-08-08: 14 real
# articles recovered cleanly in order (I through XIV).
#
# The PDF hyphenates line-wrapped words (confirmed live: "SEC-\nTION 15" for
# Section 15's own keyword), so dehyphenation runs BEFORE any other cleanup,
# same as NM/WA's own hyphen-wrap fixes.
#
# Every amended section carries a "[As amended|created ...]" bracket
# immediately after its own "SECTION N." marker -- this state's existing
# _WI_BRACKET_RE / _AMENDMENT_YEAR_EXTRACTORS["wi"] entry (built for the old
# Wikisource text) already matches this official source's identical bracket
# format unchanged.

# Hawaii -- replaces the Wikisource source (see _WS_INLINE_STATES' former "hi"
# entry, 186 pts / 18 articles, verdict BUG_PRESENT per the C07 batch 4
# research). capitol.hawaii.gov serves the constitution the same way it
# serves the HRS statutes -- NOT the single TOC-plus-body page the batch
# research assumed: a TOC page (CONST_.htm) links to the FIRST section, then
# one page per section, walked via sequential "Next" navigation -- see
# scrapeHI.py (the existing HI statute scraper) for the identical, already-
# proven pattern against this same domain. Confirmed live 2026-08-08.
#
# Each section page uses semantic CSS classes that make extraction exact
# rather than heuristic: <p class="RegularParagraphs"> holds the real
# article/title/catchline/body text; <p class="XNotesHeading">/<p
# class="XNotes"> hold "Law Journals and Reviews"/"Case Notes"/"Attorney
# General Opinions" annotations, excluded by construction (never selected).
# Within RegularParagraphs, the centered (align="center") paragraphs are
# headings (ARTICLE N, the article's own title, the section's catchline);
# the first non-centered paragraph is the real "Section N. <body text>" and
# any further non-centered paragraphs on the same page continue that same
# section's body. Confirmed live 2026-08-08 across Article I.
#
# The page declares charset=utf-8 in a <meta> tag but the server sends no
# Content-Type charset header, so plain `requests` defaults to Latin-1 and
# every multi-byte character comes back mojibake'd (confirmed: a plain
# non-breaking space is served, when decoded correctly, as the two
# characters "Â\xa0" -- i.e. the page is already double-UTF-8-encoded).
# Fixed the same way scrapeHI.py's own `_fix_encoding` does: decode as UTF-8
# once, then re-decode that string as Latin-1 bytes through UTF-8 again.
#
# Amendment history is inline and bracketed on every amended section, e.g.
# "[Am Const Con 1978 and election Nov 7, 1978]", "[L 1972, SB No 1408-72
# and election Nov 7, 1972; ren Const Con 1978 and election Nov 7, 1978]" --
# verified live 2026-08-08 across Article I. This supersedes the Wikisource-
# era note in the _AMENDMENT_YEAR_EXTRACTORS docstring above ("KS, DE, HI,
# IL, MS, NV have no per-section annotation of any kind") -- that assessment
# was of the OLD Wikisource page's format; the new official source has its
# own clean, consistent bracket format.

# Every page shares one template: <div class="page-content"> holds an
# <h3 class="constitution-subheading"> naming the document/article, then a
# flat run of <p> tags -- most (not all -- see below) carry
# class="constitution-paragraph" for body text or class="constitution-history"
# for a trailing "History: Adopted by convention...; ratified by
# electors...; L. YEAR, ch. N...; <amendment election date>." line per
# section. The "constitution-paragraph" class is NOT reliable as a body-text
# filter by itself: KS Article 1 Sec. 6's own (b) and (c) subsection
# paragraphs carry NO class at all (verified live 2026-08-08 by diffing the
# section's real official text -- (a)-(d) -- against what a class-only
# selector would return -- (a) and (d) only, silently dropping the middle of
# the section). This walks every <p> in document order instead and tracks
# section boundaries by content ("§ N." at the start of the paragraph), not
# by CSS class -- classless paragraphs simply continue whatever section is
# currently open, which is exactly right for these orphaned subsections.
#
# The Ordinance and Preamble page bundles two logically separate documents:
# the 1859 Ordinance's own 8 numbered sections (a real "§ N." series, cited
# here as article_id="ORD"), preceded by its own unnumbered enacting-clause
# recital ("WHEREAS...Be it ordained by the people of Kansas:...", captured
# as ORD's own section "0" rather than discarded), and -- textually AFTER
# the Ordinance's Section 8, not before it -- the actual constitutional
# Preamble ("We, the people of Kansas, grateful to Almighty God...").
# Verified live 2026-08-08: the Preamble is the LAST paragraph on this page,
# with no marker of its own other than its own well-known opening words, so
# it is detected by that phrase and split off into its own article_id="0"
# record (the scrape_mn/scrape_az/scrape_nc preamble convention), not folded
# into the Ordinance's Section 8.
#
# Encoding: same class of bug as HI (server declares no Content-Type charset
# so plain `requests` defaults to Latin-1 against real UTF-8 content, e.g.
# "§" comes back as "Â§") -- fixed by decoding the raw response bytes as
# UTF-8 directly rather than trusting `requests`' auto-detected `.encoding`.
# Unlike HI this is a single mis-decode, not a double-encode, so one
# `.content.decode("utf-8")` is enough (no Latin-1-then-UTF-8 round trip).
#
# Amendment years: the History line's trailing "; <Month> <Day>, <Year>."
# (present only when a section was actually amended -- an unamended
# section's History ends at its original "L. 1861, p. NN." citation with no
# further trailing date) is the real amendment/ratification election date.
# The "L. 1861, p. NN." citation itself is excluded deliberately: it is the
# ORIGINAL 1861 session-laws publication citation, present on every section
# including ones never amended since, the same "bare enactment date, not an
# amendment" pitfall already handled for TX (1876)/NE ("Adopted in Y") above
# -- so this keys on the DATE at the very end of the History text, not on
# any "L. YYYY" citation appearing earlier in it. Verified live 2026-08-08
# against all 16 History lines on Article 1 (10 amended in 1972, 6
# unamended, zero false positives either direction).

# Missouri -- replaces the Wikisource source (see _WS_INLINE_STATES' former
# "mo" entry, 360 pts / 13 articles, verdict CLEAN -- CLEAN just means no
# section-split bug, not complete: Wikisource has no Article XIV, ratified
# 2022, at all). revisor.mo.gov (the SAME ASP.NET site MO's own statute
# scraper already uses, `constit=y` query-param convention) serves the
# constitution one section per OneSection.aspx page -- confirmed live
# 2026-08-08, reachable through the US proxy (direct fetch from a
# non-US IP times out/connection-refuses, matching the statute scraper's own
# proxy requirement for this domain).
#
# The batch handoff's own warning -- "old scraper read 1st of ~8
# tables/chapter" -- is why this does NOT walk the page's HTML tables at
# all. Instead: the Home.aspx?constit=y index page links every real section
# via two anchor families in document order -- `ViewChapter.aspx?chapter=N`
# (14 article headings, e.g. "Article I  BILL OF RIGHTS") and
# `PageSelect.aspx?section=<label>&bid=<id>` (402 section links, each
# redirecting to its own `OneSection.aspx?section=...&bid=...&constit=y`,
# fetched directly here to skip the redirect hop). Confirmed live
# 2026-08-08: 402 real sections across all 14 articles (I=39 ... XIV=2),
# zero MO-side gaps; Article XIV (Marijuana Use and Regulation, the 2022
# amendment) is the one article Wikisource never had at all. Section labels
# are not always a bare integer -- MO's amendment-heavy articles (III, IV,
# V) use parenthetical letter/digit suffixes for sections added alongside an
# existing one ("18(a)", "37(a)".."37(h)", even the doubly-nested "25(c)(1)")
# -- kept as literal section_number strings rather than forced into a purely
# numeric shape, since that IS the citation form MO itself uses.
#
# Each OneSection.aspx page's real content lives in one predictable DOM
# shape (confirmed live 2026-08-08, verified against both a 1-paragraph and
# a 9-paragraph section): a `<span id="effdt">` banner ("Effective -  27 Feb
# 1945 ,  see footnote") immediately precedes a `<div class="norm"
# style="background-color:#fffff7...">` container holding one or more direct
# `<p class="norm">` body paragraphs -- the first one opens with a nested
# `<span class="bold">` carrying "<Article> Section <N>.  <Catchline>. —"
# (decomposed out to isolate the catchline from the real body text that
# follows it as the same `<p>`'s trailing text). A separate `<div
# class="foot">` sibling (its OWN "Source: Const. of 1875, Art. II, § 1."
# citation, describing the PREDECESSOR 1875 document, not this text's own
# amendment history -- the same "wrong document's history" pitfall already
# flagged for MO in the _AMENDMENT_YEAR_EXTRACTORS docstring above) is a
# sibling of the content container, never a `<p class="norm">` DIRECT child
# of it, so walking `find_all("p", class_="norm", recursive=False)` on the
# content container excludes it by construction, not by text-pattern
# filtering.
#
# Amendment years: unlike the predecessor-document "Source:" footnote (still
# correctly unused, per the reasoning above), the `<span id="effdt">` banner
# is this exact section's OWN current effective date, and it genuinely moves
# when a section is later amended (verified live 2026-08-08: Art. I Sec. 5
# shows "Effective -  06 Sep 2012", matching its real 2012 religious-freedom
# amendment). 1945-02-27 is the whole document's original convention-adopted
# date and appears on every never-since-amended section, so it is excluded
# the same way TX's bare 1876/NE's bare "Adopted in Y" are excluded above --
# only a DIFFERENT year than 1945 is treated as a real amendment. The one
# known inexact case: Article XIV's own effdt (2022) is that article's
# original adoption, not an amendment to pre-existing text -- accepted as a
# minor, documented imprecision (a genuinely new article's own creation date
# is not a meaningfully different fact from "the current text took effect
# in Y" for a faceting field), not worth a special case for one article.

# Idaho -- replaces the Wikisource source (see _WS_INLINE_STATES' former "id"
# entry, 248 pts / 21 articles, verdict CLEAN -- CLEAN means no split bug,
# not that this is skippable; official provenance is still the point of this
# whole migration). legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idconst/ -> 21
# article index pages -> one page per section, confirmed live 2026-08-08.
# `scrapeID.py` (the existing Idaho STATUTE scraper) already implements this
# exact title/chapter -> section, one-page-per-leaf crawl against a sibling
# URL branch (`/idstat/` vs `/idconst/`) on the SAME domain -- this reuses
# its two load-bearing findings directly rather than rediscovering them:
#
# 1. **Needs the US proxy.** A direct fetch from a non-US IP connection-
#    refuses (confirmed live 2026-08-08, same as the statute scraper).
# 2. **Section text lives in a `div.pgbrk`**, whose real content is legacy
#    Arbortext-to-HTML output pasted in near-verbatim (a stray nested
#    `<html><head>...` document-within-a-document, its own `<style>`/
#    `<script>` blocks, all inside one outer `<p>` -- BeautifulSoup's
#    html.parser tolerates the broken nesting and still finds the real
#    content). `scrapeID.py`'s statute pages skip 4 leading breadcrumb
#    `<div>`s inside `pgbrk` before the real content starts; the
#    constitution's `pgbrk` has no such breadcrumb divs at all -- confirmed
#    live 2026-08-08 across Article I Sec. 1, Article V Sec. 2, and Article
#    VIII Sec. 3 (the state debt-limitation section, one of the longest) --
#    `pgbrk` holds exactly one direct child div, the section's own content,
#    every time. The section's catchline is its own nested
#    `<span style="text-transform: uppercase">` -- decomposed out (DOM-based,
#    not regex-guessed, since the catchline's own text can itself contain a
#    period that would break a naive "split on first period" regex) to
#    isolate it from the body text that follows as the same span's plain
#    trailing text.
#
# No amendment-history note of any kind appears in-body on any of the three
# sampled sections above (long or short) -- consistent with the existing
# _AMENDMENT_YEAR_EXTRACTORS docstring's ID assessment ("mix several
# notation styles within the same document, most sections undated"); no
# extractor registered for "id", the same explicit non-attempt as before,
# now re-confirmed against the official source rather than assumed carried
# over from the Wikisource-era finding.

# New Jersey -- replaces the Wikisource source (see _WS_INLINE_STATES' former
# "nj" entry). njleg.state.nj.us/constitution is the NJ Legislature's own
# official page (unlike NJ's own COURT RULES, which sit behind a hard
# Incapsula wall -- a separate, much harder problem documented in the NJ
# court-rules ingester, not this page). Text updated through amendments
# adopted November 2021.
#
# Reachable directly from some vantage points (confirmed live 2026-08-08
# from a research sandbox) but NOT from the scraper box's own network
# (confirmed live 2026-08-08: a direct fetch from the box times out at
# connect, not a 403/bot-challenge -- real network-level unreachability, the
# same class of geo-fencing the fetch ladder's proxy step exists for). Uses
# the US proxy unconditionally so the one environment that actually runs the
# monthly refresh (the box) works, even though a non-proxied fetch happens
# to succeed from other locations.
#
# Reuses _parse_nj (Article > optional SECTION sub-level > numbered
# paragraph) unchanged from the Wikisource-era fix -- the body shape (bare
# "1.", "2." paragraph markers, no SECTION/Sec. keyword) is identical on the
# new source, confirmed live 2026-08-08. _parse_nj itself was extended to
# capture each article's title line while migrating this state (see its own
# module comment), and a real bug was found and fixed in its SECTION-nested
# paragraph split (see the comment at its `_NJ_PARA_RE.split` call site).
#
# This new source produces 205 sections, below the Wikisource baseline's 328
# -- investigated live 2026-08-08 rather than shipped uncounted, per the
# batch methodology's "lower count is a red flag" rule. Every one of the
# 205 top-level `\n\d+.` paragraph markers present anywhere in the fetched
# document is captured (verified by a raw regex count over the whole body
# matching the emitted count exactly, zero loss), and the emitted sections'
# total character count is 93% of the source document's total body length
# (the remaining 7% is the discarded preamble, article-title captions, and
# SECTION-heading tokens -- all expected, not a silent gap). The gap versus
# 328 is therefore a genuine COUNTING-CONVENTION difference, not missing
# content: Wikisource's transcription apparently split lettered sub-items
# ("2. a. ... b. ...", a sub-paragraph of one numbered provision) into their
# own separate points, while `_NJ_PARA_RE` -- by design, matching every
# other state's convention of keeping subsection letters inline -- only
# treats digit-led markers as new top-level sections. 328 is not being
# treated as ground truth here since it was never independently verified
# against the New Jersey Legislature's own citation scheme, only against
# Wikisource's own (third-party, since-retired) transcription.

# Oregon -- replaces the Wikisource-subpages source
# (scrape_oregon_wikisource_subpages above; STATE_SCRAPERS["or"] no longer
# points at it, see the override removed below).
# oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/Pages/OrConst.aspx is the Oregon
# Legislature's own official page (SharePoint-hosted), confirmed live
# 2026-08-08, current through the Nov 2024 amendments. Needs the US proxy --
# a direct fetch from outside the US gets connection-refused at the TCP
# level (confirmed live), not merely geo-redirected.
#
# The real document text lives in TWO of the page's `.ms-rtestate-field`
# SharePoint content divs (a Preamble-through-Article-VIII chunk, then an
# Article-IX-through-XVIII chunk), with several small boilerplate divs (page
# title, side-nav buttons) interspersed -- confirmed live 2026-08-08 the page
# splits its one logical document across two separate web-part divs. Only
# the divs over 1,000 chars carry real constitutional text; concatenated in
# DOM order rather than hardcoding an index, since SharePoint's own div count
# for boilerplate is not something to depend on staying fixed.
#
# Each article opens with a "Sec.  N.  Title\n1a.  Title\n1b.  Title..."
# table-of-contents preview (bare numbers after the first entry, no keyword)
# before the real text starts -- same TOC-collision shape as NV. Unlike NV,
# OR's real section markers spell out the full word "Section" ("Section 1.
# Title.\nBody...") while the TOC's one keyword token is always the
# abbreviation "Sec." -- confirmed live 2026-08-08: 389 of 389 real headers
# use "Section", 33 of 33 "Sec." occurrences are TOC column headers, zero
# overlap -- so anchoring on the full word alone (no lookahead trick needed,
# unlike NV) cleanly separates the two.
#
# Oregon reuses an article label after fully repealing the article that used
# it before (Article XI-A: "Rural Credits", created 1916, repealed 1942; the
# same "XI-A" label was later reassigned to "Farm and Home Loans to
# Veterans") -- confirmed live 2026-08-08, the only such reuse in the
# document. This is real history, not a scrape bug, so both are kept: the
# second occurrence of an article_id gets a "-vN" suffix, the same
# convention `_emit_sections_from_articles` already uses for a repeated
# SECTION number within one article. Article VII also legitimately exists in
# two parallel versions under one number ("ARTICLE VII (Amended)" and
# "ARTICLE VII (Original)", both still printed in full by the official
# source) and several Article XI sub-articles carry a parenthetical part
# number ("ARTICLE XI-F(1)", "ARTICLE XI-F(2)") -- both shapes are folded
# into a clean article_id (e.g. "VII-Amended", "XI-F1") by
# `_or_clean_article_id` rather than left with raw spaces/parens; these two
# shapes never collide with each other so neither needs the -vN suffix.

# Colorado -- replaces the Wikisource source (see _WS_INLINE_STATES' former

# DOCX series the existing CO statute scraper (state_scrapers/.../co/statutes/
# scrapeCO.py) already pulls for titles 01-44, at the identical
# leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/images/olls/ path -- confirmed live
# 2026-08-08: the origin URL and content.leg.colorado.gov both 403 directly,
# but the Wayback Machine mirror returns 200 with no auth required (same
# fetch pattern scrapeCO.py already relies on, reused directly below).
#
# python-docx paragraph structure (verified live 2026-08-08): "ARTICLE
# <roman>" alone on its own paragraph, the article's own name on the
# IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING paragraph (e.g. "Boundaries", "Bill of Rights"),
# then a run of body/editorial paragraphs, then repeating
# "Section N[letter]. Title. Body text..." headers, each followed by a
# trailing "Source: ..." (sometimes also "Cross references:"/"Editor's
# note:") history paragraph before the next header -- left inline in the
# section body rather than stripped (same precedent as NV's bracketed
# amendment notes: informative, and exactly what the amendment-year
# extractor below reads). Confirmed live: 29 ARTICLE headers (I-XXIX,
# matching the batch handoff), 395 "Section N[letter]." headers (11
# lettered: 16a/30a/30b/22a/22b/25a/1a/2a/9a/12a/12b), zero PART level, and
# the document ends cleanly at the 1876 convention signers' list with no
# bleed-in from adjacent content -- no boundary truncation needed (unlike
# WA's multi-part PDF).

# Rhode Island -- replaces the Wikisource source (removed from
# _WS_INLINE_STATES below). rilegislature.gov/riconstitution/Constitution/
# ConstFull.aspx is the RI Legislature's own official page, confirmed live
# 2026-08-08. Same root domain as RI's own statute scraper
# (webserver.rilegislature.gov/Statutes) but a different subdomain (www vs
# webserver) -- needs the US proxy, same as statutes.
#
# The page is Word-export HTML (mso- inline styles, MsoNormal paragraph
# classes) with real semantic ARTICLE/Section headings marked up as h2/h3 --
# but NOT consistently: Article IX's own "ARTICLE IX" heading and its first
# section ("Section 1. Power vested in governor.") are both printed as plain
# <p> tags instead of <h2>/<h3> like every other article (confirmed live
# 2026-08-08, along with two more mis-tagged section headings elsewhere --
# "Section 4. Repealed." and "Section 11. Vote required to pass local or
# private appropriations.", the only three of ~317 <p> elements whose text
# happens to match the Section pattern). A pure h2/h3-tag walk would
# silently mis-attribute Article IX's real content to the end of Article
# VIII, so this walks every h1/h2/h3/p element in document order and matches
# the ARTICLE/Section pattern against each element's OWN text regardless of
# its tag, rather than trusting the tag name -- a strict superset of a
# tag-only walk, so it cannot regress any of the correctly-tagged articles.
#
# A short ALL-CAPS line immediately after an ARTICLE marker (e.g. "OF
# SUFFRAGE", "OF THE SENATE") is that article's own title, present for about
# half the articles; captured as article_title when present. Article I has
# no title line at all (goes straight into prose), confirmed live
# 2026-08-08 -- the all-caps check is what tells the two cases apart.
#
# Word-splitting each word into its own inline `<span style='letter-spacing:
# ...'>` (a justified-text artifact of the Word export) makes a naive
# `get_text("\n", strip=True)` flatten produce one word per line throughout
# the document -- get_text(" ", strip=True) (space-joined) is used per
# element instead, sidestepping the artifact entirely rather than needing a
# rejoin-broken-lines cleanup pass.
#
# The batch research flagged mis-encoded curly quotes/dashes ("â€™" etc, a
# charset-detection artifact) as an expected problem here; not reproduced --
# confirmed live 2026-08-08 this fetch path's charset detection already
# decodes the page correctly (every character above U+2100 in the fetched
# text is a real curly quote/em-dash, not mojibake), despite the page's own
# (apparently wrong) <meta charset=windows-1252> declaration. No charset
# cleanup step is included since there is nothing live to clean.
#
# No amendment/ratification-year annotation of any kind was found in the
# text (checked live 2026-08-08: "amend"/"ratif"/"adopted" all appear only
# in generic prose, e.g. describing the amendment PROCESS itself, never
# attached to a specific date next to a specific section) -- no extractor
# registered, same as the several Wikisource states already confirmed to
# have no safely extractable format (see the _AMENDMENT_YEAR_EXTRACTORS
# module note above).

# New York -- replaces the Wikisource source (see _WS_INLINE_STATES' former
# "ny" entry). Uses the official Open Legislation (OpenLeg) API
# (legislation.nysenate.gov/api/3), the SAME API NY's own statute corpus
# already uses (scripts/us_corpus/statutes/ingest_ny_bulk.py, via
# ny_bulk/api.py + ny_bulk/walk.py). `GET /laws/CNS` is the full NY
# Constitution -- ingest_ny_bulk.py already excludes law type "MISC" (CNS's
# type) from its own statute run for exactly this reason ("the constitution
# lives in the state_constitution corpus, not statutes").
#
# Confirmed live 2026-08-08 against the real API response: root CHAPTER "CNS"
# has 21 top-level children -- one PREAMBLE (no docLevelId, no children) plus
# 20 ARTICLE containers (I-XX), each holding SECTION children DIRECTLY (no
# TITLE/PART nesting) -- 202 total leaf units via `ny_bulk.walk.iter_sections`
# (201 real sections + the Preamble). `iter_sections` already skips any node
# flagged `repealed`, so no separate handling is needed here for that.
#
# `ny_bulk.walk.iter_sections` is reused directly (pure JSON-tree walking, no
# network dependency, no reason to duplicate it) -- but `ny_bulk.api.get_law_tree`
# is NOT: its client tries `vaquill_pipeline.http_client` (a proxy-aware
# fetcher) first and falls back to bare `urllib` otherwise, and confirmed
# live 2026-08-08 on the scraper box, `vaquill_pipeline` isn't an installed
# package there, so it always falls through to bare urllib -- which hangs on
# an SSL handshake timeout against legislation.nysenate.gov from the box's
# non-US egress (the same geo-fencing class this file already handles
# elsewhere via `fetch_text(..., use_us_proxy=True)`). Routing the SAME
# request through this file's own proxy-aware SESSION instead fixed it
# (confirmed live: 200 OK, ~525KB for the full CNS tree) without touching the
# shared statute-ingestion module every other NY law type's scraper depends
# on.

# vermont is the VT Legislature's own official page, confirmed live
# 2026-08-08, current through amendments adopted through March 2021. Reuses
# the existing _VT_ARTICLE_RE/_VT_SECTION_RE pair written for the
# Wikisource-era fix (see _ART_SPLIT_OVERRIDES/_SECTION_SPLIT_OVERRIDES
# above) unchanged -- the document's own Chapter I "Article N." / Chapter II
# "§N." shape is identical on the new source, confirmed live 2026-08-08.
#
# legislature.vermont.gov's TLS certificate chain fails verification (the
# server doesn't send its own intermediate CA cert) -- confirmed live
# 2026-08-08 this is reproducible both through the US proxy AND on a
# direct connection, so it is a real server-side misconfiguration, not a
# proxy-specific MITM artifact (an unverified fetch of the exact same URL
# returns the identical ~103KB of real constitutional text every time).
# Since this is a read-only fetch of public, non-sensitive government text
# (no credentials or user data ever touch this connection), and the failure
# mode is a well-understood, reproducible server misconfiguration rather
# than an unknown risk, this one fetch disables certificate verification
# via `_fetch_text_no_verify` rather than dropping the whole state -- scoped
# to this single call, not a change to `fetch_text`'s behavior for any other
# state.
#
# The fetched page repeats a site-nav footer ("The Vermont General
# Assembly\nMontpelier, Vermont\nStatutes\n...") after the real document
# ends (right after §76, the last real section) -- truncated before any
# split runs, same convention as every other state's footer-stripping regex.
# No amendment-year extractor: VT's source carries only a whole-DOCUMENT
# currency line ("AS ESTABLISHED JULY 9, 1793, AND AMENDED THROUGH MARCH 31,
# 2021"), not per-section dates -- confirmed live 2026-08-08, same finding
# as the Wikisource-era investigation recorded in the _AMENDMENT_YEAR_EXTRACTORS
# module note above.

# Mississippi -- replaces the Wikisource source (see _WS_INLINE_STATES'
# former "ms" entry). Source is the Secretary of State's own page
# (sos.state.ms.us/ed_pubs/constitution/constitution.asp), an official state
# domain. The markup
# is Word-export span/font soup, but `BeautifulSoup.get_text()` handles that
# automatically; the real complexity is structural, not markup-cleanliness.
#
# The page is windows-1252 (confirmed via its own <meta charset>), not the
# ISO-8859-1 `requests` would otherwise guess purely from response headers --
# they agree on plain ASCII but diverge on the 0x80-0x9F range (curly
# quotes, em dashes), which this Word-export document uses throughout.
#
# Confirmed live 2026-08-08: the document opens with a GLOBAL table of
# contents ("ARTICLE 1. DISTRIBUTION OF POWERS 1 ARTICLE 2. ..." -- WITH a
# trailing period after the number, and a page number where body text would
# be) before the real "PREAMBLE" and 15 numbered articles begin. The real
# article headers never carry that trailing period ("ARTICLE 1 DISTRIBUTION
# OF POWERS SECTION 1. Powers of government. SECTION 2. ... SECTION 1. The
# powers of the government..."), so truncating at the first "PREAMBLE"
# occurrence (which the global TOC itself never contains) drops it cleanly
# without needing a period-vs-no-period regex distinction.
#
# EVERY real article then ALSO opens with its own mini table of contents --
# each real section number listed twice: once as a bare title-only preview
# ("SECTION 1. Powers of government.") and once with the real substantive
# body plus a trailing "SOURCES:" citation. Confirmed live: 595 total
# "SECTION N." matches across the document against the batch handoff's
# pre-verified 286 real sections -- almost exactly double. Same TOC-
# collision class and same fix as scrape_mi's own per-article preview: keep
# only the LONGEST body per section number within an article (the preview's
# body is always short -- the next heading immediately follows it).

# Massachusetts -- replaces the Wikisource source (removed from
# _WS_INLINE_STATES below). malegislature.gov/Laws/Constitution is the MA
# Legislature's own official page, confirmed live 2026-08-08. Same domain as
# MA's own statute site; the US proxy already wired for MA's known geo-block
# is reused directly.
#
# This reuses the SHAPE of the Wikisource-era _parse_ma/_parse_ma_part2
# (Part > Chapter > Section > Article, with Part the First flat and Part the
# Second three-level-nested) but not their regexes: the official source's
# HTML has real semantic heading tags (h2 for Part/Amendments boundaries, h3
# for Chapter+Section citations, h4 for every leaf "Article N."), so this
# walks those tags directly instead of regex-splitting a flattened,
# whitespace-mangled text blob -- the official page wraps almost every word
# of a heading in its own inline span (a justified-text artifact, same class
# of problem as RI's), which breaks a flat get_text("\n") regex approach the
# way it did for RI (see scrape_ri's module note). get_text(" ", strip=True)
# per block-level element, walked in document order, sidesteps it the same
# way. The old _parse_ma/_parse_ma_part2 functions are left in place, unused
# once "ma" is removed from _WS_INLINE_STATES below (same precedent as the
# orphaned _MD_SECTION_RE/_MD_ARTICLE_RE after MD's own migration).
#
# The page's own Table of Contents (an `<li>`-based list, confirmed live
# 2026-08-08) never uses h2/h3/h4 tags, so restricting the walk to
# h2/h3/h4/p elements skips it automatically -- no separate TOC-boundary
# detection needed, unlike the Wikisource-era fix or several other C07
# states.
#
# Chapter+Section citations are printed as one heading per h3 but with
# wildly inconsistent internal punctuation depending on whether the
# chapter's own title is repeated (e.g. "Chapter I, LEGISLATIVE POWER ,
# Section I" for a chapter's first section, "Chapter I, Section II" for
# later ones without the title, "Chapter III. JUDICIARY POWER." for a
# chapter with a title but NO Section level at all) -- confirmed live
# 2026-08-08 across all 6 real chapters. `_ma_parse_chapter_heading` handles
# all of these by finding the "Chapter <roman>" prefix and, separately, an
# optional "Section <roman>" token anywhere after it, rather than trying to
# match one rigid punctuation pattern. Unlike the retired Wikisource source,
# every chapter's first Section is explicitly marked here (no "Chapter V's
# first section has no marker" special case needed).
#
# Stops at the "ARTICLES OF AMENDMENT." h2 boundary, same scope as the old

# Arkansas -- arkleg.state.ar.us's own published PDF (per the batch research
# URL, assembly/Summary/ArkansasConstitution1874.pdf) returns a genuine HTTP
# 500 from the live server -- verified live 2026-08-08 through the US proxy AND through the scraping service's residential pool (both actually reach the
# host; the host itself errors on this exact path), so this is a broken
# link/moved file, not a geo-fence or bot-challenge block that a fetch
# strategy can route around. No working alternate path was found on
# arkleg.state.ar.us itself (its FTPDocument file-serving endpoint, which
# serves hundreds of other arkleg documents fine, 404s-as-a-blank-GIF for
# every path guess tried).
#
# Fallback source: jonesboroar.gov's DocumentCenter mirror of the IDENTICAL
# Bureau of Legislative Research-published "Constitution of the State of
# Arkansas of 1874" compiled document (same title page, same pagination,
# byte-identical body text to every other .gov mirror of this same BLR
# publication found in research, e.g. izardcountyar.org) -- a municipal .gov
# host mirroring the state's own official publication, not a third-party/
# volunteer transcription. FLAG FOR HUMAN FOLLOW-UP: this compiled edition
# is stamped "Updated as of October 5, 2015" and its last amendment is
# AMEND. 94 (2014) -- Arkansas has adopted further constitutional amendments
# since (e.g. 2016 ballot measures), so this source is genuine, official,
# and far more complete than Wikisource's 236-point baseline, but is NOT
# currently amended. Revisit if/when the real arkleg.state.ar.us link is
# restored.
#
# Structure: a large front-loaded table of contents (every amendment's own
# sub-sections listed too) ends at the single real "PREAMBLE" heading
# (verified live 2026-08-08: exactly one occurrence in the whole document).
# The real body then has THREE distinct unit shapes back to back: 20 plain
# "Article N \nTitle" articles, then a "SCHEDULE" transitional-provisions
# block, then ~93 "AMEND. N.\nTitle" amendment units (Arkansas amendments are
# separate numbered units, not folded into their target article the way
# NV's are) -- each unit's own sections use the same "§ N.  Title."
# marker throughout. Mirrors CT's main-articles-then-amendments split
# (_ct_split_articles) rather than the generic single-level helper.

# Section markers, matching the batch research's own live count. This is

# section it amended, not appended as a separate numbered unit the way
# AR/NV do it) -- no per-section amendment-citation pattern was found
# (confirmed live 2026-08-08: zero matches for the old Wikisource-era
# _TN_BRACKET_RE against this source), so amendment_years stays empty for
# every TN section here; _AMENDMENT_YEAR_EXTRACTORS["tn"] is left pointing
# at the now-inert Wikisource-era lambda rather than removed, matching this

# and the Wikisource baseline exactly on article count while recovering
# real section-level structure Wikisource's page also had. A handful of
